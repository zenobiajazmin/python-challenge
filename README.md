# python-challenge

I have create two python source code files to correspond to module 3 pybank and pypoll. 

Before I started I had met with a tutor to understand the assignment better as I am still learning how to interpert the ask.

Once I understood the assignment I went forward to complete the assignment. The code will display the results in the terminal as well as create the output in a text file in each of the analysis folders in PyBank and PyPoll.
